## Install RailsInstaller

### 1. Download RailsInstaller

Go to the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org" target="_blank">RailsInstaller</a> 
page and click your Mac OS X version under "Mac Downloads".
Don't worry about watching the video; we have all the directions you need here.

### 2. Start the Installation

Once the installer is downloaded, find the file and double-click it. This will untar the installer.
Then double click the installer. This will open an installation wizard. 

*If you are told that the installer "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer,"
control-click (or right-click) on the RailsInstaller application in the Finder.
Choose "Open" from then menu, then click "Open" in the dialog that appears.*

* Select your language, then click "OK"
* Click "Next >"
* Enter your Full Name and Email. Use the same name and email for this, GitHub and Heroku. 
* Click "Next" and "Next" and let the installer run.
* Uncheck 'Open readme.pdf'—you don't need it
* Click "Finish" and you are done!

Congratulations, you now have the Ruby development environment up and running. Go forth and do something awesome with it!
